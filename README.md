This is a suite of penetration testing tools built exclusively for Kubernetes.

### Disclaimer

I am a professional security and infrastructure engineer and these tools are for
research and educational purposes only.

Seriously please use these responsibly.

### Known issues

 - Currently the container images are based on a custom archlinux userspace (these are slow/large)
 - Some of the remote shells experience offset terminal rendering and sometimes miss capturing keys [TAB] [CONTROL]
